title: "Transforming Our Power Grid with Advanced Nuclear Technology" date: 2025-06-18 description: "Exploring the future of clean energy through the integration of MSRs, SMRs, and Fast Neutron Reactors."

Welcome to the Future of Energy

As the world seeks cleaner, more sustainable energy solutions, advanced nuclear technologies are poised to revolutionize our power grid. By combining the safety and efficiency of molten salt reactors (MSRs), the flexibility and scalability of small modular reactors (SMRs), and the innovative potential of fast neutron reactors, we can pave the way for a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable energy future.

This website explores how these cutting-edge technologies can transform our energy landscape. By reducing pollution, revitalizing our land, and providing cleaner, reliable energy, we can foster a better quality of life and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

# A Vision for West Lake: Powering the Future from the Past

Imagine standing at the edge of the West Lake Landfill—not as a site of contamination, but as a hub of innovation. A small cluster of next-generation energy systems hums in the distance. These aren’t your grandfather’s nuclear reactors. They’re molten salt small modular reactors (SMRs), built to safely and efficiently run on fuel recovered from the very waste buried here decades ago.

Step one: reprocessing. Contaminated soil is sorted and treated in a secure, on-site facility. The low-grade uranium—once considered a liability—is extracted using advanced chemical separation. Instead of being buried and forgotten, it’s transformed into fuel.

Step two: clean energy. That reclaimed fuel is dissolved into molten salt and fed into modular reactors, each roughly the size of a shipping container. These units are self-regulating, inherently safe, and built to run quietly for years without refueling.

The power generated doesn’t just light up homes—it powers the cleanup, the research labs, the trucks, the data centers. One unit might serve an entire neighborhood. A few more could support the grid, bring down local energy costs, and attract new industries.

West Lake becomes a living demonstration: how legacy waste, innovation, and clean energy can work together. A site once marked by fear becomes a symbol of transformation.
