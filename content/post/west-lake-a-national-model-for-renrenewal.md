# West Lake: A National Model for Renewal

What if the future we were promised—the one filled with progress, prosperity, and harmony with the Earth—didn’t lie in some far-off dream, but beneath our very feet?

West Lake could be that future.

No longer just a contaminated landfill, it becomes the flagship for a new American era. A place where innovation rises from our mistakes. Where healing the land becomes a source of power—literally. Where we stop hiding our failures and start transforming them.

By investing in advanced nuclear technologies—molten salt reactors, modular energy systems, and on-site reprocessing—we do more than clean up waste. We launch Missouri into the global spotlight.

This isn’t just cleanup. It’s cutting-edge infrastructure. It’s a smart energy grid powered by legacy waste. It’s a regenerative economy that fuels itself by working *with* the environment. Every dollar spent has exponential returns:
- In **public health**, as radiation exposure and related illnesses fall.
- In **the environment**, as contaminated zones turn green again.
- In **jobs and revenue**, as high-tech industries take root.
- In **education and innovation**, as students grow up with access to the world’s most exciting clean energy hub.

This is how Missouri becomes a leader—not just in energy, but in vision.

We bring the future home. And West Lake becomes a source of pride, not just for St. Louis, not just for Missouri—but for the world. A living example of what it looks like when a country takes responsibility, and turns it into opportunity.

We clean the mess we made—and from it, build the world we always hoped for.

It’s time to live in the future we were promised.


# The History and Hazards of the West Lake Site

West Lake Landfill, located in Bridgeton, Missouri, is the resting place of radioactive waste tied to the Manhattan Project—the United States’ top-secret effort to build the first atomic bomb. In the early 1970s, waste from uranium processing was mixed with soil and dumped into the landfill without liners, protective barriers, or clear public oversight.

Over time, this site became one of the nation’s most visible examples of environmental neglect—not because it was the worst, but because **so little was done for so long**, even as risks mounted. Residents raised concerns. Cancer rates climbed. Yet the response was slow, fragmented, and opaque.

As the [EPA’s own records](https://www.epa.gov/mo/west-lake-landfill) confirm, West Lake was declared a Superfund site in 1990. But decades later, the radioactive material still sits in the ground—exposed to the elements, and to the lives lived around it.

## Why It’s a Problem

Perhaps the most urgent threat comes from a **subsurface fire**—a smoldering underground reaction in the adjacent Bridgeton Landfill. Experts have confirmed that this fire is slowly migrating toward the radioactive zone. If it makes contact, it could release **airborne radioactive particulates** into surrounding communities.

Meanwhile, contamination concerns have extended beyond the landfill. The nearby **Coldwater Creek** area, which received runoff from similar WWII-era waste, has been linked to an unusually high incidence of rare cancers, autoimmune disorders, and birth defects ([Missouri Department of Health](https://health.mo.gov)).

Local families have lived with fear for decades. Some have moved. Others have buried loved ones. Many are still waiting for meaningful action.

## The Risk of Doing Nothing

The cost of inaction is not just measured in dollars—it’s measured in health, trust, and time lost:
- **Airborne risk**: An underground fire breaching the waste zone could release radioactive gases or dust into the air.
- **Groundwater contamination**: The waste sits near a major aquifer and watershed. Leaching could spread radioactive materials into the Missouri River system.
- **Escalating costs**: The longer we wait, the harder—and more expensive—it becomes to solve.
- **Erosion of trust**: Each year that passes without resolution deepens public skepticism in government and industry alike.

We may not need to assign blame—but we do need to take responsibility.

The good news? We now have the tools, the science, and the opportunity to make it right.

# Global Reclamation Models: Proof It Can Be Done

Transforming nuclear‑contaminated sites into safe, useful spaces isn’t hypothetical—it’s been happening for decades around the world. Here's how those models can guide Missouri’s future:

---

## 🇫🇷 France – Recycling and Reuse (since 1976)

France has operated reprocessing plants at La Hague since 1976. To date, over **34,000 metric tons** of spent fuel have been processed, and **95%** of it is recycled into new reactor material 1.

**Missouri Connection:**  
West Lake contains uranium-rich material that could be similarly recovered and reused locally. Over time, the reprocessing facility can pay for itself through energy generation—just as France has demonstrated.

---

## 🇯🇵 Japan – Fukushima Recovery (since 2011)

Cleanup began immediately after the March 2011 disaster. Automated cooling systems were installed within three months, and by December of the same year, reactors were in cold shutdown 2. As of 2020, $27 billion has been spent, radiation in key areas reduced by over **70%**, and towns have begun repopulating 3.

**Missouri Connection:**  
West Lake faces similar challenges—community fear, soil contamination, long-term cleanup. Fukushimas’ phased recovery shows that with sustained investment and data-driven monitoring, population return and environmental restoration are possible.

---

## 🇩🇪 Germany – Decommissioning with Care (Asse II, 1967–present)

From 1967 to 1978, around **47,000 m³** of low- and intermediate‑level waste was stored underground at Asse II 4. Today, authorities have begun retrieval efforts, with public oversight and geological safety controls in place 5.

**Missouri Connection:**  
Like Asse II, West Lake has buried radioactive material in unstable conditions (an underground fire, in this case). Germany’s experience demonstrates that retrieval—though challenging—is the responsible path.

---

## 🇸🇪 Sweden – Trusted, Local Storage (since 1988)

Sweden’s SFR underground repository has operated since 1988, handling **600 m³** of low‑ and intermediate‑level waste and receiving about 600 m³ each year 6. Crucially, local decision-making and public consultation built strong trust 7.

**Missouri Connection:**  
Community buy-in is crucial. As in Sweden, empowering local voices alongside transparent monitoring will make a future West Lake facility more acceptable and resilient.

These international examples show that:
- Cleanup and reprocessing work on a national scale.
- Long-term investment yields measurable improvements—reduced contamination, repopulation, public trust.
- When science, transparency, and partnership align, toxic legacies become sources of value.

Missouri doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel—it can adopt proven models and tailor them locally. The result? A clean, confident, and forward‑looking community.

# Why It Makes Sense to Reprocess Locally

The radioactive waste buried at West Lake isn’t just a threat—it’s also a resource. Buried within that contaminated soil is **uranium**, a material with real economic and energy value.

## A Hidden Asset, Not Just a Liability

Uranium is the fuel that powers nuclear reactors around the world. Even low-enriched uranium—like what’s found in the West Lake Landfill—can be reprocessed and reused in **advanced reactor systems**, including molten salt reactors.

This approach mirrors the core principle of **conservation of energy**: energy can’t be destroyed, only transformed. Rather than sealing this potential away forever or shipping it off to burden another community, we embrace it—**transforming a legacy of harm into a source of healing and progress**.

- **Uranium price per lb (2024):** ~$90  
- **Hundreds of tons** of uranium-contaminated soil are present  
- Reclaimed material can be used to power **modular reactors** that supply clean energy to Missouri for decades

Instead of spending millions to discard it—we can use it.

---

## The Danger of Moving It

Transporting radioactive waste is dangerous, expensive, and logistically unsound.

- The U.S. has over **13.5 million large trucks** on the road each year  
- Trucks account for **9% of all fatal crashes**, despite being only ~4% of registered vehicles ([NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/))  
- Missouri highways are **already over capacity**, especially in the St. Louis region

Adding **convoys of nuclear waste trucks** to already congested highways introduces unacceptable risk. One accident—whether a collision, spill, or even a mechanical failure—could trigger catastrophe or mass panic.

And even if the waste is moved safely…  
**Where would it go?**  
**Whose land would we risk next?**

We don't need to pass the problem on. We need to own the solution.

---

## Financial Sense Meets Moral Responsibility

Hauling radioactive waste across the country would cost **hundreds of millions of dollars**—just in transport and shielding. That same investment could fund a **local reprocessing and clean energy facility**:

- Built adjacent to the existing site  
- Designed to handle and neutralize the exact waste present  
- Staffed and operated by trained Missourians  
- Feeding energy directly into the grid

It keeps the risk contained—and turns it into *return*.

---

## The Missouri Opportunity

This isn’t just a fix—it’s a future. A facility like this would spark growth across sectors:

| Category                     | Projected Impact                           |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Permanent jobs**           | 300–500+ (reactor ops, lab techs, engineers) |
| **Construction-phase jobs**  | 1,000+ (skilled labor, contracting, materials) |
| **Support industries**       | Fabrication, shielding, HVAC, clean-tech, security |
| **STEM & trades education**  | Partnerships with Missouri universities, trade schools |
| **Spillover innovation**     | R&D, robotics, energy storage, AI monitoring |
| **Long-term local revenue**  | Clean energy generation, federal matching grants, job tax base |

These aren't just jobs—they're **careers in a future-facing economy**.

This is what it looks like to take responsibility for our past while building prosperity for generations to come.

We don’t outsource the burden.  
We transform it into leadership.  
That’s conservation—in every sense of the word.

# The West Lake Opportunity

What if the site that once symbolized environmental failure became the place that redefined environmental leadership?

West Lake isn’t just a cleanup site. It’s a chance to lead the nation in turning radioactive legacy waste into **clean energy**, **job creation**, **public health improvements**, and **restored trust**.

This is more than a fix—it’s a future.

---

## A State That Leads

Missouri has always stood at the crossroads of America. Now, we stand at a crossroad in history.

By investing in advanced nuclear reclamation right here:
- We **keep the economic benefit in-state**
- We **pioneer a new kind of infrastructure**—smart, modular, and regenerative
- We **show the nation** that progress doesn’t mean abandoning the past—it means transforming it

This becomes a place others look to.  
West Lake becomes our **proof of concept**.  
**Our pride.**

---

## A Healthier Missouri

The ripple effects of restoring West Lake extend far beyond the fence line.

- **Reduced cancer and illness rates** in nearby communities
- **Cleaner air and water**
- **Fewer toxins passed to future generations**
- **Relieved pressure on local healthcare systems**

By healing the land, we help people live longer, healthier lives.

---

## A New Economic Engine

This isn’t a temporary construction site—it’s a long-term opportunity.

We create:
- **Permanent high-paying jobs** in nuclear tech, science, logistics, security, and clean energy
- **Support industries** in fabrication, shielding, sensors, automation, and robotics
- **Training programs** and university partnerships that put young Missourians into future-proof careers

And we spark new businesses:
- **Advanced manufacturing**
- **Battery storage**
- **AI-driven safety monitoring**
- **Smart energy grid tech**

We don’t just clean up—we *build up*.

---

## A Story Worth Sharing

Most places bury their mistakes and hope the public forgets.  
We can be different.

We can own the story:  
➡ From Cold War byproduct to climate-era solution  
➡ From public neglect to public health  
➡ From poisoned ground to pioneering ground

---

## What Success Looks Like

- Clean land, safe neighborhoods  
- Affordable energy from reclaimed fuel  
- National headlines about innovation, not tragedy  
- Students from around the world studying what we built  
- Local families proud to say:  
  *“That used to be a problem. Now it’s our solution.”*

This is the West Lake opportunity.

Let’s rise to meet it.


# Could the Site Be Declared a Disaster to Garner Emergency Funding?

**Yes—and it may be overdue.**

If the underground fire breaches the radioactive zone, this could trigger:

- Airborne radioactive particulate release  
- Contamination of the Missouri River watershed, a major source of drinking water, agriculture, and shipping  
- Evacuations, health crises, and long-term land value collapse  

## Federal Emergency Pathways:

- **Stafford Act Declaration**: If the situation worsens, Missouri’s governor could request a Presidential Disaster Declaration, unlocking FEMA funds.  
- **CERCLA (Superfund) Emergency Removal Authority**: Already in play—but underused. It allows for fast-track action when there’s “an imminent and substantial danger to public health.”  
- **Congressional Emergency Appropriations**: If elevated to a national infrastructure risk, Congress can pass a standalone funding bill (as was done for 9/11, Katrina, and Flint).  

> **Framing Suggestion:**  
> _This isn’t just Missouri’s risk. The Missouri River touches 10 states, feeds the Mississippi, and supports the nation’s economy. If fire meets waste, it’s not just local cleanup—it’s a national emergency._

## 🔥 How Could We Possibly Contain This Underground Fire?

The subsurface smoldering event (SSE) is chemically different from an open flame, but still incredibly dangerous. It's been burning since **2010**.

### Current Mitigation Techniques:

- **Isolation barriers**: A physical wall of clay and grout was installed to block migration toward the radioactive zone  
- **Gas extraction wells**: To relieve pressure and reduce flammable methane buildup  
- **Temperature and gas monitoring**: To track fire behavior in real time  

### Additional Potential Measures:

- **Inert gas injection** (e.g. nitrogen or CO₂) to starve oxygen  
- **Excavation + extinguishment** in cooler areas (very risky, rarely done)  
- **Cryogenic cooling zones** to create artificial cold firebreaks  

> ⚠️ **Limitation**: None of these are permanent fixes. The fire is in a chemically complex landfill.  
> **Solution?** Excavation + reclamation is the only way to permanently eliminate the long-term fire-and-waste interaction risk.

## ⚡ How Long Could the Waste Power Us?

This is an exciting part of the story: _what we once buried could power us for decades—if we reprocess it properly._

### What's in West Lake?

- Mostly **low-enriched uranium** and byproducts from **WWII-era uranium refining**  
- While not reactor-grade today, it contains **recoverable uranium isotopes (U-238)**, useful in fast reactors or molten salt reactors  
- Exact tonnage is uncertain due to poor 1970s record-keeping, but estimates suggest **hundreds of tons** of uranium-contaminated soil  

### Rough Calculation (Conservative Estimate):

- Let’s say **300 tons** of uranium-contaminated material, of which **0.7% is usable uranium** (~2.1 tons of U)  
- A modern **1GW reactor uses ~20 tons** of enriched uranium annually  
- **Molten salt reactors** or **SMRs** (Small Modular Reactors) can run on reprocessed fuel with far greater efficiency (sometimes **2–5x longer fuel cycles**)  

### With efficient reprocessing and modular use, West Lake uranium could:

- Fuel a **small 100MW reactor for 10–15 years**  
- Provide **proof-of-concept material** for a national waste-to-energy pipeline  
- Save **hundreds of millions** in imported fuel and disposal costs  

> **Bottom line:** It won’t power Missouri forever—but it could launch the **first regenerative reactor hub** in the U.S., demonstrating that **waste → wealth is real.**

---

## How Do We Know That?

- **DOE Fuel Cycle Reports** show reprocessing potential of low-enriched uranium in waste stockpiles  
- France’s **La Hague facility** has reprocessed **34,000+ tons** of spent fuel with **95% recyclability**  
- New U.S. **thorium** and **molten salt reactor** designs aim to use “nuclear waste” as fuel  
- **ORNL** (Oak Ridge National Lab) and **INL** (Idaho National Lab) have conducted tests on **uranium recovery from legacy waste streams**  

> _“Even legacy uranium materials can be reprocessed with next-gen technology to yield usable fuel for SMRs.”_
