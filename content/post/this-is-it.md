# She

Came with her parents today to take the rest of her things and some of mine.

Doesn't have enough room for all of the things she wants to take.

I can't sleep.

She's seeing someone else now. I still love her. I move on, with less.

Alone.

Bitter, Intoxicating, loneliness. 

Soul mate

I want to sob into a deep sleep and live in my strange dreams.

Heart's beat to shit. Neglected. Turning.

Saving it for them. I don't want it. 

The majestic Orangutan lives in solitude. I get it.


# I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I...

I'm scared.

I don't have a person. I don't deserve a bond. I'm the problem. I missed my chance.

I relish my alone time. 

I want to feel good. I make it worse so easily. I am so sad it's crushing me. 

> I'm scared, I don't, I don't, I'm the problem, I relish, I want, I make, I am. 

## I don't

Want to lose her, miss her, make her sad anymore.

# Solace

She is finally free. 

Solace for us. 

I've felt like a horrible person for years. I disregard my own well-being. "Taking on more will fix this". Knowing I couldn't give enough.

Unwittingly competing with seductive Fantasies. Demonizing. Ego. Avoidance. 

Addiction.

Avoidance.

Look at me! See me! Watch me struggle. Check out. Start over with someone else.

I took care of you, love you, lived with you. I gave her everything I had, married you, shared your pain, and felt alone.

Used.

Her love had been gone for a long time. 

I brought it up. She denied it. I felt it.

Moroseness to petulance. "Nothing is wrong". Hiding in different parts of the house with her phone. "Nothing is wrong". Can't look at me while having sex. "Nothing is wrong".

Fights kick off our weekends.

"We never do anything fun". I'm over worked. My wife can't help. I cant do it all. If I don't I'll lose everything.

"Live in the moment!" with my 401k. 

Toxic positivity like a soiled bandage applied directly to my hemorrhaging.

"You're so negative" as she's having an affair

"I can't give you enough", refuses to get a job until she moves out. She blames  me for her not being able to get a job. Moving out freed her. She is no longer relegated to starting new projects to avoid accidentally finishing anything.  

She comes back today to take more equipment that I'm still over extended on.

I want her to see the irony. Knowing that she can't makes me feel alone.

Jaded

Ruined

I made a mistake. I've made mistakes. Lot's of mistakes.

Surely I've suffered enough for my past mistakes.

This is it.

I've been waiting to see her for six months.
I'm crestfallen. I hugged her. She let me. Reminding me that there is no warmth for the wicked.
