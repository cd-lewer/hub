# This is it

She came with her parents today to take the rest of her things and some of mine.

She doesn't have enough room for all of the things she wants to take.

I can't sleep.

She's seeing someone else now. I still love her. I move on, with less.

Alone.

This bitter lonliness is intoxicating. 

Soul mate 246

I want to sob into a deep sleep, live in my strange dreams.

Heart's beat to shit. Neglected. Turning.

Saving it for them. 

The majestic Orangutang lives in solitude.


## I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I...

I'm scared.

I don't have a person. I don't deserve a bond. I'm the problem. I missed my chance.

I relish my alone time. 

I want to feel good. I make it worse so easily. I am so sad it's crushing me. 

> I don't. I Relish. I want. I don't. I make. I am. 

# I don't

Want to lose her.
miss her.
Make  her sad anymore.

She is finally free. 

Solace for us. 

I've felt like a horrible person for years. I  disregard for my own wellbeing. "Taking on more will fix this". Knowning I couldn't give enough.

Unwittingly competing with seductive Fantasies. Demonization. Ego. Avoidance. 

Addiction.

Avoidance.

Why wouldn't she see me?

I took care of her, loved her, lived with her. I gave her everything I had, married her, and felt alone.

Used.

The love had been gone for a long time. 

I brought it up. She denied it. I felt it.

Moroseness to petulance. Nothing is wrong. Hiding in different parts of the house with her phone. Nothing us wrong. Can't look at me while having sex. Nothing is wrong.

Fights kick off our weekends.

"We never do anything fun". I'm over worked. My wife can't help. I cant do it all. If I don't I'll lose everything.

"Live in the moment!" with my 401k. 

Toxic positivity like a soiled bandage applied directly to my hemoraging.

"You're so negative" as she's having an affair

"I can't give you enough", refuses to get a job until she moves out.  She blames me for her not being able to get a job. Moving out freed her. She is no longer relegated to starting new projects to avoid accidently finishing anything.  

Comes back to take more equipment that I'm still over extended on. Smiles with teeth that my income cared for.

I want her to see the irony. Knowing that she can't makes me feel alone.

Jaded

Ruined

I made a mistake. I've made mistakes. Lot's of mistakes.

Surely I've suffered enough for my past mistakes.

This is it.

I've been waiting to see her for six months. I'm crestfallen. I hugged her. She let me. Reminding me that there is no warmth for the wicked.
