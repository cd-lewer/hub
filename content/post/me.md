# It's really me
![Photo of me](/hub/images/my-photo.jpg)

*Not becoming someone new—becoming someone true.*
I’ve been shedding the noise: people, possessions, distractions. It might look like loss, but it’s refinement. What’s left is real—my craft, my grit, my vision.
I’m not lost. I’m being revealed.
