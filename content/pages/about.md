## Who I Am

Hi — I'm Charles, a wanderer, coder, and guitar slinger.  
I create, I explore, and I build things that help people live with more freedom and meaning. I’ve worn a lot of hats: musician, developer, designer, traveler, and occasionally philosopher. This site is my space to share my work, thoughts, projects, and the road I’m on — literally and creatively.

## What This Site Is About

This is a digital campfire where I post things I’m working on, thinking about, or just want to remember. You might find:

- Personal stories from the road and life experiments  
- Projects and prototypes (web, automation, DIY hacks)  
- Music I've written, recorded, or performed  
- Notes on health, minimalism, tech, and freedom  
- Thoughts that don’t fit in social media boxes

I don’t chase likes — I chase the signal in the noise.  
This site is updated often, sometimes messily, but always honestly.

If something resonates with you, feel free to reach out.  
If not, I hope it sparks something anyway.
