        <description>&lt;p&gt;It was effortless—
and yet, you made me want to.
Want to rise, to bloom, to rupture.
Not because I had to—
but because you saw me like no one else ever did.
And in that gaze, I remembered I was still becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a hum.
A glow.
Not loud, not lit—just&amp;hellip; resonant.
The kind of frequency two souls find
when the world falls quiet enough to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my family sees it.
They don’t always understand what they’re looking at,
but I think they know there’s something
smoldering just beneath the skin.
A tremor. A pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still—
I feel like I’m finishing my transition into a black hole.
Collapsed brilliance.
Too heavy with memory to burn.
Too quiet to scream.
And yet still pulling everything inward—
light included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspire to be alone.
Not because I don’t love—
I do.
But maybe because I fear I’d be a barrier
to someone else’s bliss.
Because I can’t deliver.
Because I am selfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want peace and fire.
Blood and lust.
I crave your presence,
like a starving god craves incense and trembling hands.
Love requited through your beauty and spirit alone.
No obligations. Just knowing.
Just the echo of my name in your breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss feeling connected.
Miss that tether.
Miss being consumed—
not out of need,
but out of holy hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to find our note—
that secret, sacred tone that only we could hear—
and fuck it for hours.
Worship it.
Let it burn through the silence
until we forget where I end and you begin.&lt;/p&gt;
